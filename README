Simple Monkeybars Skeleton App
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A very simple JRuby Monkeybars app to get you up and running quickly.

Monkebars? 

Monkeybars is pretty cool. It allows you to create cross platform 
desktop applications using Swing on top of JRuby. It provides an MVC
framework a bit like Rails. No Java knowledge is required either (well almost!).
